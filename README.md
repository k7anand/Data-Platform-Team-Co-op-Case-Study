Requirements


Please create a new table with the following transformations on the above command separated data:



Hint: A few libraries are available to help you with this, pandas, duckdb, pyspark, dask, etc. SQL may be able to help as well. You also donâ€™t need to use any of these. Creative solutions are always welcome.



1. FlightCodes column: Some values are null. Flight Codes are supposed to increase by 10 with each row so 1010 and 1030 will have 1020 in the middle. Fill in these missing numbers and make the column an integer column (instead of a float column).



2. To_From column: Should be split into two separate columns for better analysis! Split on '_' to create two new columns respectively. Also, the case of the column is not very readable, convert the column into capital case.



3. Airline Code column: Clean the Airline Codes to have no punctuation except spaces in the middle. E.g. '(Porter Airways. )' should become 'Porter Airways'.
